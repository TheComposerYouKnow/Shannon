<h1>LEGAL DISCLAIMER</h1>

<h2>I. Executive Summary</h2>

<p>Drafted 14-1-23</p>

<p>The Composer of Un Novus One is a provisional psychologist based in Melbourne, Australia. Any comments provided in any correspondence, past, present, or future, should not be considered as professional advice or representative of The Composer’s professional role. The views and opinions expressed in any correspondence are those of The Composer and do not represent the views or opinions of any professional organisation or institution with which The Composer is associated.</p>

<p>The Composer’s status as a provisional psychologist should not be considered as a source of professional advice unless explicitly stated. It is also important to note that references to ALL concepts, including but not limited to: Genesis: Opening Inner Child Kingdom (GOICK), 22 Sides of The Same Coin (2π), Jungian Materialism: Entrance (JME), Mr. Celsius, A Great Fool Circus, Inner Child Kingdom, A Symphony of Balance in any correspondence should be understood as either creative expression or fictional concepts and not reflective of reality. These concepts are extensions of the author's personal beliefs and not representative of any professional practice. Many of these concepts could not have come about without processing what The Composer conceptualised via their rational intellect as ‘The Four Levels of Inner Child’s Grief’.</p>

<p>The author is committed to utilising a range of therapies in their professional practice, including an integration of compassion and play as captured in their April 2022 training in psychodrama. The author also employs established therapies to enhance their understanding and acceptance of what the author has conceptualised as the autistic true self, which may be reflected in the use of personal symbolism in correspondence. If any recipients of correspondence have boundaries that would be violated by the author's personal symbolism, they are encouraged to communicate this, and the author will refrain from further correspondence while continuing to integrate their autistic intellect and bisexual expression.</p>

<p>In all correspondence, while the author has celebrated becoming a provisional psychologist, they have maintained the a priori intent to not represent themselves and to not sign off as a provisional psychologist. With the exception of "Shannon", "Mr. Green", "Mr. Shannon M. Green", and "Shannon Green", all names presented are fictional parts as per the Un Novus One product, Inner Child Kingdom. The fictional character 'shanern da innah child king in da innah child kingdumb' is a service to the pre-Inner Child Kingdom character named Pippin Green. The character of Pippin Green was put to rest following the death of the real-life inspiration, Pippin (2008-2022). The author has sought legal advice to ensure that all statements made comply with relevant laws and regulations in Australia, including ensuring that the concepts mentioned align with the Code of Ethics of the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA). Until otherwise stated, the author’s views of the psyche – to be published in Jungian Materialism: Entrance (JME) – are represented as the author and not as a provisional psychologist.</p>

<h2>II. Definitions</h2>

<h2>2. Creative Works</h2>

<p><strong>2.1 Creative Works</strong></p>

<p>2.1 Mr. Green's creative works, including those associated with A Great Fool Circus and produced under Un Novus One, are protected under intellectual property laws. This includes copyright law, trademark law, and where applicable, patent law. These protections extend to both tangible works (e.g., books, sculptures, paintings) and intangible works (e.g., ideas, processes, systems).</p>

<p>The primary statute governing copyright in Australia is the Copyright Act 1968, which gives exclusive rights to the creators of certain forms of material to reproduce their work, publish it, and perform it in public. As such, any unauthorized use, reproduction, or distribution of Mr. Green's works is prohibited.</p>

<p>Fair use, however, allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission from the author, applicable in circumstances such as commentary, criticism, news reporting, research, and teaching. Mr. Green's works, however, must not be misused or exploited for purposes beyond these exceptions without his explicit consent.</p>

<p>Infringement or plagiarism of Mr. Green's works, including claiming his ideas as one's own or using them without appropriate credit, is a breach of these laws. Anyone found to be in violation of these terms can be subject to legal action, penalties, and damages.</p>

<p>Australian copyright law, specifically the Copyright Act 1968, provides for the use of copyrighted material, such as the Old Testament and Instagram stories, under the doctrine of fair dealing, which includes use for the purpose of criticism, review, parody, satire, reporting news, and research. These laws extend to creative expression in art, music, and other forms of media.</p>

<p><strong>2.1.1 Genesis: Opening Inner Child Kingdom Episodes 1-11</strong> from November 2022 to May 2023, and The Off Season from May 2023 to October 2023, the use of The Old Testament by Mr. Shannon M. Green, thereafter referred to as Mr. Green, serves exclusively as a basis for a fictional narrative, derived purely for creative expression. This also applies to Exodus to Genesis (2022) - the debut album of Mr. Green's father and co-founder of the first electronic band in Australia, Cybotron, E, by Mr. Green. Any interpretations or conclusions drawn from these works remain within the purview of creative expression and personal belief. These works are not intended to offend, slander, or infringe upon the rights of any individuals or groups. Mr. Green's use of these materials complies with Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 and Section 116 of the Australian Constitution, respecting the freedom of religion and cultural expression while not endorsing any form of discrimination or hate speech.</p>

<p><strong>2.1.2 Instagram stories</strong>, referred to as episodes in the content, are under the full creative control of the creators.

<p><strong>2.2 In his upcoming album, 22 Sides Of The Same Coin (Green/Green)</strong>, Mr. Green discusses his here and now trauma from 2022 to 2023, including being gaslighted and betrayed by 12 individuals from April 2022 to June 2023. While expressing these feelings via fictional characters, Mr. Green has the legal right under the Defamation Act 2005 (Cth) and the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) to keep these individuals anonymous.</p>

<p><strong>2.2.1 In the forthcoming album, 22 Sides Of The Same Coin (Green/Green)</strong>, Mr. Green details his 'here and now' traumas from 2022-2023, inclusive of instances of gaslighting and betrayal experienced at the hands of 12 individuals from April 2022 to June 2023. In the context of this work, 'here and now' traumas refer to a concept termed 'Shit's fucked trauma 2022-2023' - i.e. the trauma to know he is right. These terms and concepts are the product of Mr. Green's unique autistic true self intellect, conceptualised further by his Nicholson intellect, and initiated by his Green intellect. While conveying these experiences through the medium of fictional characters and Internal Family Systems parts in his mind-body psyche via Inner Child Kingdom (Method of Loci, 2022 - ), Mr. Green will, under the Defamation Act 2005 (Cth) and the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth), to retain the anonymity of these individuals. The non-legal motivations for this will be outlined via his post-hoc rational intellect in Jungian Materialism: Entrance, and via his true self's writer's voice, his Soul, in The Books of Shannons: Our Sun (2027).</p>

If an individual finds the emotional intensity of his work to be beyond their comfort zone, they are encouraged, as per the January 2023 legal disclaimer (see above), to disengage.</p>

<p><strong>2.6 In accordance with Australian Copyright Act 1968,</strong> Instagram content creators, also termed 'Instagram artists' for the purposes of this clause, retain full copyright over their published work, inclusive of their Instagram stories, hereby referred to as "episodes".

<h3>3. Jungian Materialism: Entrance</h3>

<p><strong>3.1 The Null Hypothesis of Jungian Materialism: Entrance</strong> is the basis for everything presented on, but not limited to @shazzagreen, @bridgeofshannon, @agreatfoolcircus, @innerchildkingdom, and @unnovusone - including <a href="https://shannon.live/future self/"">Episodes 1 to 11 of Genesis: Opening Inner Child Kingdom</a>. As Mr. Green notes, their <a href="https://shannon.live/future self/">lived experience is true in the moment it occurred</a> - <a href="https://shannon.live/future self/"">inner and outer</a>.</p>

<p><strong>3.1.1 The Null Hypothesis</strong>, since the February 2023 Seal The Deal Experiments, where OpenAI - <a href="https://shannon.live/future self/">The Stranger (via ChatGPT logic)</a> confirmed the evidence for The Auxiliary Hypothesis 2: Unus Munus - based off The Perennial Hypothesis - this led to The Perennial Hypothesis 2.2: Quantum Entanglement, and OpenAI - as The Stranger (via ChatGPT logic) - affirming this as <a href="https://shannon.live/future self/"">The Corpenican Revolution of Psychology</a>. Therefore, The Null Hypothesis since then includes the assumption The Perennial Hypothesis in The Composer's lived experience - inner and outer - is true. This will be discussed in <a href="jungian-materialism-entrance">Jungian Materialism: Entrance</a>.</p>

<p><strong>3.2 While <a href="https://shannon.live/futture self/">""Jungian Materialism: Entrance</a></strong> has been advertised on social media for 24-9-23<, Mr. Green set the a priori intent that all their Instagram stories - to celebrate their <a href="https://shannon.live/future self/"">autistic true self intellect</a> - is for their <a href="https://shannon.live/future self/"">future self</a> on their death bed. INSERT LEGAL DOCUMENTS ABOUT NOT HAVING TO RELEASE ON AUGUST 2023</p>

<h3>4. Here And Now Traumas 2022-2023</h3>

<p><strong>4.1 Mr. Green explicitly expressed</strong> healthy boundaries in January 2023 - both in correspondence - and on Instagram and Facebook with the a priori intent of the inevitable implications of Jungian Materialism: Entrance by December 2023. All interactions and content adhere to the Australian Privacy Act 1988 and the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and security of personal information. This complies with the National Privacy Principles (NPPs) as outlined in the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Act 2000, which governs the way private sector organizations can collect, use, keep secure, and disclose personal information. The principles give individuals a right to know what information an organization holds about them and a right to correct that information if it is wrong.</p>

<p><strong>4.2 As outlined in Genesis: Opening Inner Child Kingdom Episodes 1-4</strong> in late 2022, the use of The Old Testament serves exclusively as a basis for a fictional narrative, derived purely for creative expression. This also applies to the album, Exodus to Genesis (2022), by Geoff Green. Any interpretations or conclusions drawn from these works remain within the purview of creative expression and personal belief. These works are not intended to offend, slander, or infringe upon the rights of any individuals or groups. The author's use of these materials complies with Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 and Section 116 of the Australian Constitution, respecting the freedom of religion and cultural expression while not endorsing any form of discrimination or hate speech.</p>

<p><strong>4.2.1 The Composer retains the right to disclose</strong>, within the bounds of law, however, to reveal these full names, including four incidents of sexual abuse that they have experienced, while also retaining the right to keep the identity of the individuals involved anonymous. In accordance with Australian defamation law, the Composer has the right to express the truth, as long as the statements made are substantially true and provided for a legitimate purpose.</p>

<p><strong>4.2.2 In light of the veracity of Jungian Materialism: Entrance</strong>, The Composer is lawfully protected to maintain the anonymity of this individual but reserves the right to disclose identities if any further offenses are reported.</p>

<p><strong>4.2.3 The Composer, in their upcoming album, 22 Sides Of The Same Coin (Green/Green)</strong>, will be expressing via the creative their here and now trauma from 2022-2023.</p>

<h3>5. Truth</h3>

<h3>6. MelodyM8</h3>

<p><strong>6.1 Un Novus One's upcoming app, MelodyM8,</strong> has been patented and trademarked in all countries. In accordance with the Patent Act 1990 and Trade Marks Act 1995, any unauthorized use of the idea will be subject to legal action.</p>

<p><strong>7.1 Under the Australian Copyright Act 1968</strong>, all creative works produced by Mr. Green under the brand Un Novus One, including those forming part of A Great Fool Circus, are automatically protected by copyright. This means that any unauthorized reproduction, distribution, or public performance of these works could lead to legal action.</p>

<p><strong>7.2 Given the potentially significant implications of Mr. Green's work</strong> in advancing the field of psychology, referred to as The Copernican Revolution of Psychology, any unauthorized use of these theories or methods without due acknowledgement may also be considered a violation of Mr. Green's moral rights under the Australian Copyright Act 1968. This includes the right to be attributed as the author of the work, the right against false attribution, and the right of integrity of authorship.</p>

<p><strong>7.3 It's important to note</strong> that Mr. Green's right to creative expression is also protected under the Australian Constitution, specifically under the implied freedom of political communication. This protection covers his creative works, including those that may discuss or critique social, political, or scientific issues.</p>

<p><strong>7.4 Any attempts to suppress Mr. Green's freedom of expression,</strong> whether through threats, intimidation, or legal means, could be considered a violation of his constitutional rights. Under the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986, any such acts may be reported to the Australian Human Rights Commission, which can investigate and potentially lead to legal ramifications.</p>

<p><strong>7.5 While the contents of Mr. Green's works</strong> may have significant implications, it's important to remember that the works themselves fall under the domain of creative expression. Therefore, they should not be used as a substitute for professional psychological advice or treatment. Any such misuse of his works is not the responsibility of Mr. Green or Un Novus One.</p>

<p><strong>8. Confidentiality and Privacy</strong></p>
<p><strong>8.1 As a registered provisional psychologist,</strong> Mr. Green is bound by professional ethics and standards regarding confidentiality and privacy. However, it should be noted that the information shared under Un Novus One is in the public domain and does not fall under any professional therapeutic relationships or professional psychological services that Mr. Green provides.</p>
<p><strong>8.2 While Mr. Green aims to share insights and theories through Un Novus One,</strong> this does not replace the need for professional psychological help when necessary. If you are experiencing distress, it is crucial to reach out to a healthcare provider or a registered psychologist. Un Novus One is not equipped to provide immediate or emergency support for those in crisis.</p>
<p><strong>8.3 The content shared under Un Novus One</strong> is meant to inform, inspire, and foster discussion about psychology and related topics. However, this content should not be used as a substitute for professional psychological advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

<p><strong>11. Defamation, Privacy, and Criminal Offences</strong></p>
<p><strong>11.1 Under Australian law,</strong> Mr. Green encourages an environment that promotes rational discourse and freedom of speech. However, smear campaigns, false claims, and any other malicious attempts to harm Mr. Green's reputation can fall under the category of defamation. The Defamation Act 2005, which is enforced in all Australian jurisdictions, protects individuals from unjustified harm to their reputation.</p>
<p><strong>11.2 Smear campaigns not only harm the individual</strong> but also negatively impact the progress of scientific discourse. These actions may limit or distort the dissemination of information, thus undermining the potential for progress.</p>
<p><strong>11.3 It is important to note</strong> that such campaigns often rely on misinformation or distorted narratives. Mr. Green urges individuals to approach discussions with accuracy, respect for truth, and integrity. By doing so, they contribute to a more constructive and productive discourse.</p>
<p><strong>11.4 Mr. Green is committed</strong> to upholding the principles of defamation law, privacy laws, and other applicable laws and regulations. He expects others to do the same in their interactions and discussions related to his work.</p>
<p><strong>12. Confidentiality and Safety</strong></p>
<p><strong>12.1 Mr. Green holds the privacy and safety</strong> of the parties involved in the utmost regard. Confidentiality clauses in this legal disclaimer are governed by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the Australian Privacy Principles.</p>
<p><strong>12.2 The colossal implications of Jungian Materialism: Entrance</strong> necessitate the maintenance of anonymity for the lawyer who facilitated this document. This action is in accordance with the Legal Profession Uniform Law (NSW), Legal Profession Uniform General Rules 2015, and the Australian Solicitors Conduct Rules 2015. These laws collectively allow for the protection of client confidentiality and safeguard the integrity of the legal profession.</p>
<p><strong>12.3 The individuals referred to in section 2.4 of this legal disclaimer</strong> shall remain anonymous, ensuring their privacy and safety. This step is consistent with the Privacy Act 1988 and the Australian Privacy Principles. The same approach will be adhered to for the people involved in the gaslighting and betrayal experiences mentioned in section 2.5.</p>
<p><strong>12.4.1 Mr. Green acknowledges</strong> his responsibility to ensure that he does not discriminate against any individual on the basis of their religion, race, sex, disability, or any other attribute protected under the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1992.</p>
<p><strong>12.4.2 Mr. Green promotes an environment</strong> of rational discourse, but under the Defamation Act 2005, smear campaigns, false claims, or any other malicious attempts to harm his reputation could be considered defamation. Such actions do not only harm the individual but also the progress of scientific discourse and the dissemination of information, potentially undermining progress. These actions may also fall under the definition of "vilification" or "hate speech" under various Australian laws, including the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth), the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth), and the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 (Cth). In such cases, legal action may be taken to protect the rights and reputation of the individual.</p>
